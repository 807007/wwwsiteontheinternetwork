During my grade 11 computer engineering class, I was assigned to design and build something of my choice, and I chose to make a logic gate based LED cube display.

Most LED cube displays use a microcontroller, so the purpose of this was to challenge myself.

I learnt about Karnaugh maps for converting truth tables into logic, did some multi-input optimization, and then put it together in tinkercad, as seen here:

I then had the task of building the circuit, which wasn't that bad, but soldering was a nightmare for me.

It took me months to solder something a proffesional could in less than an hour.

Needless to say, I will try my best to avoid any soldering in the future.

In the end, it didn't work, either because of the soldering (most likely) or because of how the circuit was wired.

I didn't have enough time left in the semester to fix it, so that was the final state.

In conclusion, I learned that my circuit design is immaculate, but my soldering is not.

After all, this was a challenge assignment meant to demonstrate my skills.
